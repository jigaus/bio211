# Housekeeping
1. Set your working directory and read in countries.csv and bat_tongues.csv.
```{r}
TYPE HERE
```

# Histograms
2. Plot a histogram of the palate length of the bat tongues data frame.
```{r}
TYPE HERE
```
3. Remove the outliers from the Birth rate crude (per 1000 people column). Then, plot the histogram with the bins changed from the default setting.
```{r}
TYPE HERE
```

# Scatterplots
4. Plot a scatterplot of any of the two columns in the countries dataframe. Then, interpret what the graph is saying; is there any sort of reasonable correlation? Remember to remove your outliers.
```{r}
TYPE HERE
```
